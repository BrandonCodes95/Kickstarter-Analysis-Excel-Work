# Kickstarter-Analysis-Excel-Work
In-depth analysis of kickstarter projects in regards to funding and success rate. Identifying trends through statistical analysis.
## Overview of Project
   The purpose of this project was to help Louise by providing her with useful information on the Kickstarter industry prior to her own launch. Translating the data into easy to read charts and tables, giving her detailed data on previous performance of other Kickstarters based off of goal/pledge amount, timeline of fundraiser, and the type of fundraisers. This will allow Louise to plan realistically how she should format her own kickstart to ensure its success.  

## Analysis and Challenges
Through charting the data I was able to provide Louise a visual to see how theater startups in each month performed throughout the year, as well as how the goal amount impacted the success percentage. This is a very useful analysis to quickly be able to gain insight on when to launch and what a resonable monetary goal would be if she wants to ensure success. Using excel functions Some of the challenges were making sure that the information that is pulled is relevant and accurate for Louise and can be used to create actionable items. With so much data it is very possible to get lost and start creating too many charts about minor details that will confuse the client. Having clear and concise data is key! Also ensuring the code/formulas input are accurate and pulling the right data and information. If the data is pulling info from the wrong cells or the formulas are not transferring over to other cells appropriately this will cause integrity issues with the data.

## Results
What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  Based off of the data there is a clear best time to launch Kickstarters that are centered around theater. This time is the spring season, months March-June see the highest uptick in success rate. Peaking in June having a 65% success rate for those launched during that time. Also there is a sharp decline following June and continues to decrease into the winter months.

What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Looking at the data, it shows how someone should construct their funding goals and that there are some clear limit points one should cap the goals at. This will give them the highest percentage of reaching their goal. Projects that have goals between $1000-$19,999 have an over 50% success rate. Specifically, under $5000 having an above a 64% chance of success. As they goal gets higher there are fewer and fewer projects that meet their mark. There are some projects in the higher range that provide a above 50% chance of success but this is most likely due to the low number of total projects in that range

What are some limitations of this dataset?
Some of the limitations of the data is that it just gives me information about the results. It does not show some of the metrics that would explain how the results came to be. Such as engagement by the creator during the campaign, how visible was the campaign on the website or how aggressively it was marketed to backers. 
What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Some of the other graphs that could be shown is percentage of success based off of length of time of a campaign.
